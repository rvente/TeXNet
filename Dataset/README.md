This is our dataset, mined from January 2018's arXiv source code.
`normalized_out.txt` contains upwards of 500 thousand examples of LaTeX mathematical
expressions, normalized and cleaned so as to eliminate non-compiling examples and to
facilitate deep learning tasks.

Special thanks to [Brian Newbold](http://bnewbold.net/), an internet archivist, who provided
the raw form of the data we pre-processed. Details in the paper.
