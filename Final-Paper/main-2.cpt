Examples flow from archive.org and are stored on our
    disks, where we extract the \texttt{tar} files first by day, then by
    submission, into the document folders. Then \texttt{pandoc} pulls in all of
    the dependencies of this particular document and writes out one stand-alone
    document with macros expanded. Then we match the regular expression
    \verb|\((.*?)\)| that \texttt{pandoc} uses to wrap mathematical expressions.
    As a general tool \texttt{pandoc} can convert between other markup language
    in the same way, making it useful for standardizing data from disparate
    sources.^^E^^L
